                       Hi! My name is Michelle. I am a 25 year old college grad looking to pursue a career in web development. 
                       <br><br>
                After earning my degree in Communication Studies, I've worked a few jobs and haven't quite yet found the right match. I originally pursued Social Media coordiantion but found my interest dwindling. I then worked as an admin coordinator for a door company and was bored to pieces. 
                <br><br>
                I currently work as a sales manager for a company that makes aerial dance equipment. This job has made me realize that I would like to be very far away from customer service. 
                <br><br>
                I've felt a bit directionless so I decided to further my education with this coding bootcamp and hope to make a career out of it.
                <br><br> 
                For fun, I take aerial fitness classes like pole dancing and lyra hoop. I use the rest of my time to hang out with my family and friends. 
                <br><br> 
                My favorite TV show is TLC's My 600 LB life. I have an orange Tabby cat named Henry.</p>
